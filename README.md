# ClpChk â€” A simple media comparison tool
Ever wanted to compare two videos or images side by side? ClpChk is a simple tool that allows you to do that quickly. It has a user-friendly interface and supports zooming and panning, making it easy to analyze differences in video quality.

I developed this tool to help with my own media analysis. I found no way to quickly to compare a compressed version of a video or image file side-by-side. I hope it can be useful for others as well.

This is a relatively simple web app based on React & Electron. I will be adding features & fixing bugs as I have time.

## Features
Available as a deployable web app, ClpChk offers the following features:
- **Side-by-side comparison**: View two media files simultaneously.
- **Zooming and panning**: Easily navigate your loaded media files for detailed analysis.
